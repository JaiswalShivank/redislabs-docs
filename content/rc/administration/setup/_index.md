## Test section (do not publish)

The following is a test of the Markdown parser

Term1 <a id="term1"></a>

:   This is a definition with two paragraphs.  Here is a supporting sentence.  This is the second supporting sentence.  And a third.

   This is the second supporting paragraph.  Here is a supporting sentence.  This is the second supporting sentence.  And a third.

: Here is another definition for Term 1.

Term 2 <a id="term2"></a>

: This paragraph defines the second term (called "term 2" here).  Here is a supporting sentence.  This is the second supporting sentence.  And a third.

   Term 2 has additional nuances:

   - Nuance 1
   - Nuance 2
   - Nuance 3

Term 3 <a name="term3"></a>

: This is a "smartypants" test---one that sees how certain forms are rendered.
